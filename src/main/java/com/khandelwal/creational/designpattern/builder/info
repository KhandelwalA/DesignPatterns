Builder is a CREATIONAL design pattern
When to use
1. When an object needs more than 3 to 4 arguments in constructor for its creation
Why to use
1. Its always error prone to create object with too many arguments in constructor as
	a. It is quite possible to miss one or many of the argument value while creating object.
	b. It is quite possible to provide argument values in wrong order which even harder to debug.
2. Java has limitation of maximum 255 parameters in a method/contructor
3. Less prone to scenario in which object is used in inconsistent state. 
Like if any object created with default constructor and it gets used before setting required values via some setters or other method
then object is in inconsistent state at use but this is not possible if object is created with builder pattern if not done deliberately.
